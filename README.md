# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) seeks the shortest route visiting all given locations exactly once. It's a classic combinatorial optimization problem with applications in logistics, routing, and computer science.

It is a fundamental problem in the field of computer science and algorithms. It involves finding the shortest possible route that visits each of a given set of cities exactly once and returns to the original city. In terms of data structures and algorithms (DSA), the TSP can be approached in various ways:

Graph Representation: 
Cities and distances between them can be represented using a graph, where cities are nodes and distances are edges. This allows for efficient traversal and computation of distances.

Brute Force:
The simplest approach involves trying all possible permutations of city visits and calculating the total distance for each permutation. While conceptually simple, this method quickly becomes impractical for larger numbers of cities due to its exponential time complexity.

Dynamic Programming:
Dynamic programming techniques can be employed to optimize the brute force approach. By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions, dynamic programming can drastically reduce the computational time required to solve the TSP.

Heuristic Algorithms: 
Various heuristic algorithms such as Nearest Neighbor, Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, and Ant Colony Optimization are commonly used to find approximate solutions to the TSP. These algorithms provide good solutions in a reasonable amount of time but do not guarantee optimality.

Mathematical Optimization Techniques:
Linear programming and integer programming formulations can be used to model and solve the TSP mathematically. These techniques can provide optimal solutions for small to moderate-sized instances of the problem.
